# 🚚 Dropr — Campus Peer-to-Peer Delivery App

**Dropr** is a smart campus-based delivery app that connects students who need help (Needrs) with students willing to help (Droprs). Whether it’s picking up parcels, dropping off books, or running errands inside campus — Dropr makes student life easier, collaborative, and more efficient.

## ✨ Features

- 🔁 **Dual Roles**: Students can switch between Needr and Dropr roles.
- 📦 **Request & Fulfill Deliveries**: Needrs post requests; Droprs accept and fulfill them.
- 💬 **Real-time Chat** between Needr and Dropr.
- 🔔 **Order Status Flow**:
  - `Pending` → `Accepted` → `Awaiting Confirmation` → `Completed`
- 📍 **Live Dashboards** for both Needr and Dropr.
- 🔒 **VIT-only Login** with domain restriction (`@vitstudent.ac.in`)
- ✅ **Email verification** via Firebase Auth
- 🔥 Built with **Flutter + Firebase**
